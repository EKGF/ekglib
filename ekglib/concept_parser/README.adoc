= Concept Parser
:icons: font

The Concept Parser reads the given Turtle input file and loads each concept into
an in-memory graph (based on `rdflib` with a reasoner based on `owlrl`).
The inferred results will be written to the given output file.

NOTE: This is an extremly basic implementation, much more to come here.

# pipeline

Lightweight pipeline framework used by `ekglib` to define and run data processing steps.

Key pieces include:

- Decorators for declaring pipeline steps.
- An example pipeline in `example.py`, exposed via the `pipeline-example` console script.

See the top-level `ekglib` README for installation and how to invoke the CLI entrypoints.

# maturity_model_parser

The `maturity_model_parser` is used to generate Markdown files from RDF files that describe the pillars, levels,
capabilities and "KGIs" of the Maturity Model for the Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG/MM)
to generate the content for [https://maturity-model.ekgf.org](https://maturity-model.ekgf.org).

This work is currently in progress.

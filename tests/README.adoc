== Fixtures

For a number of common variables we have some fixtures that initialize themselves from
files in the `./tests` directory:

|===
| Fixture | Example value

| `kgiri-base`       | `https://kg.yourcompany.com`
| `ldap-bind-dn`     | `cn=Directory Manager`
| `ldap-bind-auth`   | `admin-password`
| `ldap-naming-context` | `dc=yourcompany,dc=com`
|===

Create a one-line text file with the name of the fixture and the value as its content.

== Run all tests

To run all tests you can use the `./run-tests.sh` script in the root of the repo:

....
cd <repo root>
./run-tests.sh
....
